# QuotesLearner
A semi-simple quote learning program I made to support me during GCSE exam season.

How to use:
To edit the quotes inside the program, you need to edit quotes.csv
Then you need to run database.py and use that to update the quotes.db file.
Then run main.py and you will be able to revise your quotes!

There's already the quotes I used inside the database, so that should serve as an example.
