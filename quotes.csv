A3 - Mr Birling - He expects to be treated with privilege due to his wealth and power. Offended tone.|Then look at the way he talked to me

A2 - Mrs Birling - Links gender and poverty to imply that this combo is the worst in society. Demonstrates Mrs Birling is uncaring towards other women. Implies that the rich can do no wrong, and the poor can do no good.|Girls of that class
A3 - Eric - DA makes it more personal. Emotive language creates feeling of vunerability. Colloquial language sets Eric apart from the upper class.|you're not the kind of father a chap could go to when he's in trouble
